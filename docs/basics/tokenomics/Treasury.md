Subsocial will follow the lead of Polkadot and Kusama by implementing an on-chain treasury
which is controlled by token holders. We are planning to have an elected council similar to Polkadot and Kusama.

We have not made a final decision on when on-chain governance (and hence the treasury) will
be initiated.

As noted previously, we plan for the treasury to receive 25% of the tokens produced through inflation.
