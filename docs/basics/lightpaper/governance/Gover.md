In a previous section, we described how space owners have several options at their disposal for
governing their own space. We have tried to make space governance flexible enough to meet the owner's requirements.

In addition, there is also a layer of governance for the Subsocial chain as a whole. Just as we see for
Polkadot, holders of the Subsocial token will be able to create and vote for on-chain proposals that will be automatically executed.

The governance of the chain will decide how the chain upgrades and how the treasury funds are 
spent. Possible upgrade examples include modules that provide new functionality options for all spaces, or
whether Subsocial should include integrations with other social networks or chains.
