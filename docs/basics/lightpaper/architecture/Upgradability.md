Substrate allows blockchains to be seamlessly upgraded without hardforks. We have already
witnessed forkless upgrades in Polkadot and Kusama. The same on-chain governance and
upgrade mechanisms are available to all Substrate-based blockchains.

This approach to blockchain technology is perfect for Subsocial. We believe that it isn’t possible
to know everything upfront. The functionality and parameters of the platform will have to be changed
along the way as the community finds bugs or as it becomes necessary to make improvements.

If you have an idea for new chain functionality, then you can 
[suggest a feature](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe5EaRY1izH5Aaj2_WMKGSnBsSyJ90JPc9_ikydxHuQ6lqW0Q/viewform) 
or create a pull request to Subsocial's [node repo](https://github.com/dappforce/subsocial-node).
