Publishing content to a website owned by a traditional social media company means that you
have few rights over how the content is monetized or censored. Moreover, your login
credentials are stored on their central database. You have to trust that these companies will be
able to keep your private data safe, and we have already seen many of the largest 
Web 2.0 companies (including Facebook and Twitter) suffer from data breaches and leaks. 
To top it off, there is no way to verify that they are not selling your data.

The technologies powering the new paradigms of Web 3.0 allow users to retain ownership of their
own data. Rather than publishing content to a platform owned by a social media giant, you are
now given the ability to publicize and monetize your content, which can be fully independent of
trusted third parties. Additionally, your login credentials are stored locally on your devices, rather than in a
centralized database.
