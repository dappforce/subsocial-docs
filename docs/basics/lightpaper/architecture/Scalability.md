Subsocial allows communities to create their own space on top of the Subsocial chain, such that
all communities share the same underlying blockchain. This provides shared network effects:
users will be able to seamlessly join any community on any alternative clients for Subsocial 
(compared to traditional social media networks being separated, such as Facebook and Twitter).
