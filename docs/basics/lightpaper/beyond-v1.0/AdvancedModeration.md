One of the products of scale, is that a large community could have a lot of experience with
moderation and maintaining a good blocklist of content. For a space dedicated to children, it
would be important to block a lot of content which would be deemed highly undesirable.

At the other end of the scale, there can be thousands of small communities that only have a
single moderator, or don’t have the same experience, or they don’t have the time to keep up
with the latest content to block.

The solution to this is to allow communities to inherit the state of moderation from a larger space
on Subsocial. This will relieve the burden on smaller communities and allow for effective
management of undesirable content.
