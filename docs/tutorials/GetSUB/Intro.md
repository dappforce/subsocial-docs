Thanks to our partners at MEXC, HydraDX, and StellaSwap, SUB tokens are easily available to the public!

Here is a short summary of the three options:

[Get SUB on MEXC](/docs/tutorials/GetSUB/mexc), which is a centralized exchange, allowing you to use a huge number or crypto tokens to get SUB.

[Get SUB on HydraDX](/docs/tutorials/GetSUB/hydradx), which is a Polkadot parachain with a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) 
that supports Polkadot wallets like [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/), 
and [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/) (Mobile). If you are native to the Polkadot ecosystem, it may be your best choice.

[Get SUB on StellaSwap](/docs/tutorials/GetSUB/stellaswap), which is a DEX built on Moonbeam, 
a Polkadot parachain that focuses on EVM technology. Other EVM chains include Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. 
If you already have a wallet like Metamask, you can easily use Moonbeam and Stellaswap with your existing wallet.

If you are completely new to crypto and Web3, we recommend using MEXC and the [Talisman wallet](https://www.talisman.xyz/) for getting SUB.

The liquidity on all exchanges may be different, resulting in different amounts of slippage when swapping to SUB. As a rule, lower slippage is better, 
so if you are aiming to acquire a lot of SUB, you may want to check which options is better for you.

The following pages have tutorials for getting SUB on MEXC, HydraDX, and StellaSwap.
