title: How To Use Subsocial On A Mobile Device
---
Currently, the best way to access Subsocial (and many other Dotsama apps) from a mobile device is with Nova Wallet. 
They have built a fantastic in-app browser that can connect with Substrate based apps.

To download the wallet, head to https://novawallet.io/. 
Apple users can download from the Apple Store, and Android users can download the .apk file from Nova's GitHub.

Once you install and open the app, you will be able to either create a new wallet, or import an existing one.

If you already have a wallet, you can import it using your seedphrase, the raw private key, or the .json file.

If you do not have a Substrate account already, go ahead and create a new one. First, select a nickname for your wallet.

On the next screen, you will be given a 12 word seed phrase. **Write this down (in the correct order), store it in a safe place, and never tell it to anyone**.

On the next screen you will have to re-enter your seed phrase in the correct order, to make sure you wrote it down. Enter it in the correct order and continue.

Now that you have imported an existing account, or created a new one, you can see the home page of the app. 
There are two main things we care about here: the DApps button in the middle of the bottom row, 
and the identicon in the top right corner (the circle with dots). For now, click on the identicon.

*Fun Fact: Each Substrate account has a completely unique identicon.*

This is the wallet screen, where you can add more accounts, and manage your existing ones. Next, tap the ⓘ icon on the right side.

Here you can see a list of your account's addresses for various Substrate chains. If you scroll to the bottom, you can find your Subsocial address. 
If you tap on Subsocial, or the three dots to the right, you will be able to copy your Subsocial address, if you want to send it to someone else.

*Fun Fact: Every Substrate account has a base Substrate address. Addresses for the various Substrate chains are all derived from this base Substrate address. 
Users of Substrate have different account addresses for every chain, but they are all tied to the same account. 
To get a better understanding of this, sign into [Sub.ID](https://sub.id/#/) either on your desktop browser with the polkadot.js extension,
or through Nova Wallet's app browser.*

Back on the home screen, tap on DApps at the bottom, and then either scroll down to Subsocial, 
or switch to the Community tab. Then, tap on Subsocial App to open [app.subsocial.network](https://app.subsocial.network/) in Nova's browser.

Right away, you will get a pop-up requesting access to the site. In order to use Subsocial, you will need to allow access.

Once you allow access, you can browse around, or tap the **Sign In** button in the top right corner, and then select your account to sign in with.

*Fun Fact: There is no sign up process for Subsocial. Anyone with a Substrate account already has a Subsocial account.*

After signing in, you can start using Subsocial, by upvoting a post, for example. When you do so, a pop-up will appear, 
showing which account you are performing the action with, and the transaction fee. Select confirm and the post will be upvoted.

You may have to wait a second or two while the block is confirmed on-chain for the like to be applied. 
You can see at the bottom that the transaction is in process. 
However, the upvote button will become green as soon as you sign the transaction, and you are free to scroll away - you do not need to wait on it.

That is the end of our basic tutorial on how to use Nova Wallet to browse Subsocial from your mobile device. 
If you have not already done so, you can set up your profile and create your very first space to start posting in, or go comment on other people's posts.

**Note: At the time of writing, you will need SUB tokens to perform actions on the network. 
SUB tokens are not publicly available at the moment, but will be soon. However, you can still read content on the platform without tokens.**
