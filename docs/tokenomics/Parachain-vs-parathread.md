title: Parachain vs Parathread
---

> A chain developed with Substrate can at different points in its lifetime assume one of three
states: an independent chain with a secured bridge, a parachain, or a parathread. ([source](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ru/learn-parathreads))

Subsocial has acquired one of Kusama's parachain slots, in addition to operating a standalone chain.
These two chains will be connected by a bridge, and will share the same token.

There are currently no plans for a Polkadot parachain, but the option is still available for the future.

Should Subsocial fail to secure a parachain slot in the future, that chain will transition to a parathread.
