The Subsocial treasury is a chain-level pot of tokens that can be spent on community proposals
to help further the project and its ecosystem. It is envisioned that the treasury could sponsor things such as 
ongoing development of the Subsocial blockchain, creating different web and mobile apps, alternative feed algorithms, marketing, and growing
the community.

Where we see one area of improvement over, say, Kusama’s treasury, is to have three councils
to cover the three aforementioned aspects of treasury expenditure. Each council will ideally be
made up of experts in that domain: technology, marketing, and UX (user experience).
