title: Posts and Spaces
---

The building blocks of Subsocial are **Spaces**, **posts**, **comments**, **upvotes**, **downvotes**, and **follows**. They
will be familiar to everyone who has used any social media platform.

The best way to understand them is through comparison to familiar platforms:

**Spaces** are similar to:

- Blogs on Blogger,
- Publications on Medium,
- Accounts, pages, or groups on Facebook,
- Accounts on Twitter and Instagram,
- Channels on YouTube,
- Servers on Discord,
- Forums on Discourse.

**Posts** are similar to:

- Posts on Facebook and Instagram,
- Articles on Medium,
- Tweets on Twitter
- Videos on Youtube.

How about something more advanced? How can we recreate popular platforms for Web 3.0
using Subsocial?

- **Airbnb** – apartment listings are spaces, while reviews are posts.
- **Quora** – a question is a post, answers are comments/replies.
- **Stack Overflow** –
  - Answer writers can be rewarded, e.g. by the question writer.
  - The distribution of payouts can also be split between what the question owner
and what the community finds to be the best answer.
- **Patreon/OnlyFans** – supported users could be represented as spaces who are
rewarded through paid subscriptions and community votes, etc.

All posts and spaces are associated with public key pairs (accounts). This means all content
can be correctly attributed to the post's author and/or owner. The cryptography used is the same
as found in Polkadot and Kusama. Subsocial supports the Polkadot{.js} extension that allows for
easy key management in the browser, or, in the future, an offline vault via Parity Signer.

With built-in support for IPFS, your space can take advantage of decentralized content hosting.
