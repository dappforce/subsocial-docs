title: Cross-Chain Interaction With Parachains
---

One of the most exciting aspects of Polkadot is the ability for one parachain to trustlessly
interact with another. This also means it should be possible to use any token on Polkadot or Kusama to
make payments on Subsocial. The primary interest for this is likely to be paying for subscriptions
in either DOT, KSM, or any of the various stablecoins. Additionally, it would allow integration 
of functionality from other parachains.

We will acquire a parachain slot on Kusama.
